    <h2>Internet </h2>
    <p> The internet is a global network of connected computers. It lets people share information and talk to each other. You can use it to visit websites, send emails, use social media, and access many online services from anywhere. </p>
    <h2> Web </h2>
    <p> The web, or World Wide Web, is a group of linked documents and other media that are accessed through the internet via a web browser. It enables you to view and navigate websites, basically full of text, pictures, videos, and much more, through the internet. </p>
    <h2>How are the Internet and Web different?</h2>
    <p>The internet is a global network of computers and servers that lets people communicate and share data. The web is a service on the internet that lets you access websites and online content using browsers like Chrome or Firefox.</p>
    <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
    <p> American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a character representation system developed with 7-bit binary numbers representing English letters, digits, and symbols. It can display 128 different characters but is limited, representing just the most basic ones and not supporting the majority of languages and symbols.

        Unicode is much more advanced, representing almost all possible characters and symbols in most world languages. It comes in different formats such as UTF-8 and UTF-16, allowing it to represent millions of characters, unlike ASCII. </p>
    <h2>What is UTF-8?</h2>
    <p> Unicode Transformation Format-8-bit (UTF-8) is a method to encode characters. It is very popular because it uses only one byte for common English text and can also handle all Unicode characters, which supports many languages and symbols. </p>
    <h2>URL</h2>
    <p> A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is the web address used to locate resources on the internet. It indicates where a resource is and how to get to it; this includes, for example, the protocol (such as HTTP), the domain name, and the file path.</p>
    <h2> Domain Name </h2>
    <p>A domain name is like the name of a website, such as google.com. It replaces the long numbers (IP address) of a server, making it easier to remember and visit websites.</p>
    <h2>HTTP</h2>
    <p>HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a way for web browsers and web servers to communicate. It helps load web pages, including text, images, and videos, by defining how messages are sent and received over the internet.</p>
    <h2>HTTPS</h2>
    <p> HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a safer version of HTTP. It keeps the communication between your web browser and a server secure. HTTPS encrypts sensitive information, like passwords and credit card details, to prevent others from intercepting it.</p>
    <h2>IP Address</h2>
    <p> An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device, like a computer or phone, on a network. This way, one may locate that device and send or receive data over the Internet. </p>
    <h2>DNS</h2>
    <p>The Domain Name System is the phonebook of the internet. It translates website names into IP addresses, which are used by computers to find each other. That way, people can visit websites without having to memorize long numbers. </p>
    <h2>W3C Recommendations</h2>
    <p>W3C Recommendations are regulations laid down by the World Wide Web Consortium, which ensure that websites work as they should. Everything from HTML to CSS and XML, they help in maintaining a harmonious and accessible web experience.</p>
    <h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
    <p> Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a flexible language in storing and sharing data. It allows its users to define customized tags for certain content. It is mainly used in exchanging data between systems.

        Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML) is an extended version of HTML and is somewhat stricter since it follows some rules of XML. It keeps documents well-formed and compatible with most web browsers and other applications based on XML.
        
        HyperText Markup Language (HTML,), is the standard language used to create or format web content, with tags and attributes, including text, images, links, etc.
        
        HTML5 is the last version of HTML, featuring new elements, attributes, and APIs that enable the creation of interactive websites with enhanced support for multimedia, data storage, and compatibility with mobile devices.</p>
