        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p> LeBron James, famously known as <em>The King</em>, has been my inspiration in playing basketball. Born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, he started playing basketball at age 9 and began playing professionally at age 18. I really admire his playstyle, skills, and especially his clutch moments that have been crucial in helping his team. Growing up, I was able to watch his games through television, including all of his championship games, and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching him because those matches showed why he is the team captain. </p>

            <dt><strong>Teams</strong></dt> 
            <dd> He played for three NBA teams. He started with the <mark>Cleveland Cavaliers</mark> from 2003-2010, then moved to the <mark>Miami Heat</mark> from 2010-2014 (4 seasons). He returned to the Cleveland Cavaliers from 2014-2018, wrapping up over 11 seasons with them. His current team, and my favorite, is the <mark>Los Angeles Lakers</mark>, where he has been playing from 2018 to the current season, tallying 7 seasons. </dd> <br>
            <dt><strong>Statistics & Awards</strong></dt>
            <dd>Owning over <strong>four NBA championships</strong> through his three NBA teams and earning the <strong>Finals MVP</strong> in those championships, he also earned <strong>four Olympic medals</strong> representing the United States of America. This definitely shows his dedication and skill to the game, not only in the United States but around the world. He is also the <strong>all-time leading scorer</strong> with <strong>41,452 points.</strong> </dd> <br>
            <dt><strong>Charity & Foundation</strong></dt>
            <dd>He was not able to earn a degree, but despite this he used his platform and earnings to help the people in need. Over $100 million to education and charity. He is known for his philanthropic efforts, which include the LeBron James Family Foundation and the I PROMISE program. Which is one of the reason why I admire him the most. He often gets criticized whenever he has bad plays, but I don't really mind seeing him loose because to me he is a great person that inspires me to be hardworking, generous and humble.</dd>
