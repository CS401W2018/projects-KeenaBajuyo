        <p id="firstpar"> <strong>LeBron James,</strong> famously known as <span class="yellow"><em>The King</em></span>, has been my inspiration in playing basketball. Born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, he started playing basketball at age 9 and began playing professionally at age 18. I really admire his playstyle, skills, and especially his clutch moments that have been crucial in helping his team. Growing up, I was able to watch his games through television, including all of his championship games, and I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed watching him because those matches showed why he is the team captain. </p>

            <dd class="lightwhite">He played for three NBA teams. He started with the <span class="yellow"><strong>Cleveland Cavaliers</strong></span> from 2003-2010, then moved to the <span class="yellow"><strong>Miami Heat</strong></span> from 2010-2014 (4 seasons). He returned to the Cleveland Cavaliers from 2014-2018, wrapping up over 11 seasons with them. His current team, and my favorite, is the <span class="yellow"><strong>Los Angeles Lakers</strong></span>, where he has been playing from 2018 to the current season, tallying 7 seasons. </dd>

            <dd class="lightwhite">Owning over <span class="yellow"><strong>four NBA championships</strong></span> through his three NBA teams and earning the <span class="yellow"><strong>Finals MVP</strong></span> in those championships, he also earned <span class="yellow"><strong>four Olympic medals</strong></span> representing the United States of America. This definitely shows his dedication and skill to the game, not only in the United States but around the world. He is also the <span class="yellow"> <em>all-time leading scorer</em></span> with <span class="yellow"><strong>41,452 points.</strong></span></dd>
            <dt class="subheading"><strong>Charity & Foundation</strong></dt>
            <dd class="lightwhite">He was not able to earn a degree, but despite this he used his platform and earnings to help the people in need. Over $100 million to education and charity. He is known for his philanthropic efforts, which include the <span class="yellow"><strong>LeBron James Family Foundation</strong></span> and the <span class="yellow"><strong>I PROMISE</strong></span> program. Which is one of the reason why I admire him the most. He often gets criticized whenever he has bad plays, but I don't really mind seeing him loose because to me he is a great person that inspires me to be hardworking, generous and humble.</dd>
