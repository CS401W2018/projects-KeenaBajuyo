        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Lebron James also know as <em>The King</em> has been my inspiration in playing basketball. Born in Akron, Ohio. He started playing basketball since at age 9 and started playing professionally at age 18. I admire his playstyle, skills and most especially his clutch moments that have been very crucial in helping his team.  </p>

            <dd>He played for 3 NBA Teams. He started playing in Cleavand Cavaliers from 2003-2010 and move to Miami Heat from 2010-2014 (4 Seasons) then he went back to Cleavand Cavaliers from 2014 - 2018 wrapping up with over (11 seasons). His current team now is my favorite team which is Los Angeles Lakers from 2018 - Current Season tallying of (7 seasons). </dd> <br>
            <dt><strong>Statistics & Awards</strong></dt>
            <dd>Owning over 4 NBA Champions and 4 Olympic Medals definitely shows his dedication and skill to the game not only in the United States, but around the world. He is also the all-time leading scorer with 41,452 points. </dd> <br>

            <dt><strong>Charity & Foundation</strong></dt>
            <dd>He was not able to earn a degree, but despite this he used his platform and earnings to help the people in need. Over $100 million to education and charity. He is known for his philanthropic efforts, which include the LeBron James Family Foundation and the I PROMISE program. Which is one of the reason why I admire him the most. He often gets criticized whenever he has bad plays, but I don't really mind seeing him loose because to me he is a great person that inspires me to be hardworking, generous and humble.</dd>
