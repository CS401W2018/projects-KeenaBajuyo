        <h2>My Favorite Sport</h2>
        <p><strong>Basketball</strong> is a sport I really love playing. My dad got me into it, and we often watched games on TV together. The amazing plays, the pressure of the game, and the cheering crowd are some of the reasons I got hooked. I remember what my dad and I used to do, which was to bet on which team would win, and if I won, he would buy me ice cream. These moments inspired me to start playing basketball in elementary school. I used to go for hours to the gym to get in shape, practicing my ball-handling skills, shooting, and passing, with hopes of one day playing in the WNBA. Because of this, I began playing for my school as a varsity player and acquired a scholarship grant in high school as a student-athlete. It became such a huge part of my life, and I enjoyed every moment of it.</p>
        <h2> My Favorite Team</h2>
        <p>My favorite basketball team is the <strong>Los Angeles Lakers</strong>. I have been a Lakers fan ever since I started watching and playing basketball. I always admire the history and the players of each team. The Lakers have had some of the most iconic and greatest players in NBA history, including <em>Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, and LeBron James</em>. I really love the Lakers despite the roster changes from time to time; they just have the most effective playing methods that I really enjoy. In fact, I am already saving up to watch one of their games this December.</p>
