                <h2>Joseph Smith's First Vision</h2>
                <p>The First Vision is the name given to the event that took place in the spring of 1820 when Joseph Smith, a youth living in Palmyra, New York, prayed to know which church he should join. In response to his prayer, he received a vision in which God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him. They told him that none of the churches that then existed were right and that he was not to join any of them. This vision marked the beginning of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and led to the organization of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is considered a foundational event in the history of the church.</p>
                <h2>The Gathering of Israel</h2>
                <p> The "gathering of Israel" refers to the return of the Jews to the land of Israel as prophesied. This is significant in both Judaism and Christianity as the fulfillment of scriptural prophecy and the coming of the Messiah. It can be interpreted literally as return to Israel on a physical plane and spiritually as return to religion and religious practice.</p>
