                <h2>Joseph Smith's First Vision</h2>
                <p>The First Vision refers to the event in the spring of 1820 when Joseph Smith, a young boy living in Palmyra, New York, prayed to know which church to join. In response to his prayer, he experienced a divine vision in which God the Father and Jesus Christ appeared to him. They told him that none of the existing churches were correct and that he should not join any of them. This vision marked the beginning of the restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ and led to the founding of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is considered a foundational event in the history of the church.</p>
                <h2>The Gathering of Israel</h2>
                <p> The "gathering of Israel" refers to the prophesied return of the Jewish people to their ancestral homeland, Israel. This concept is significant in both Judaism and Christianity, symbolizing the fulfillment of biblical prophecies and the coming of the Messiah. It can be understood both literally, as the physical return to Israel, and spiritually, as a return to faith and religious observance.</p>
