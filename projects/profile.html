    <h1> Aloha! I'm Keena Bajuyo</h1> Welcome to my profile page. I was born and raised in the Philippines. My favorite movie series would have to be <em> Marvel Cinematic Universe </em> where the famous <strong>Avengers </strong>movie is included. I love all the heroes in movie, they all have unique abilities and stories that resonates for me and my friends, but if I were to choose my favorites heroes that would be:</p>

    <h3><mark>My Top 5 favorite heroes:</mark></h3>
    
    <ol type ="A">
        <li>Wanda Maximoff - Scarlet Witch</li>
        <li> Tony Stark - Iron Man</li>
        <li>Stephen Vincent Strange - Doctor Strange</li>
        <li> Carol Danvers - Captain Marvel</li>
        <li>Steve Rogers - Captain America</li>
    </ol>

   <p>In fact, during my senior year in highschool. Our graduation photo has two themes one would be formal and the other people who inspires you. Although, hereos are fictional characters I still chose to portray my favorite hero because she inspires me to be brave and that is Wanda Maximoff a.k.a <em>Scarlet Witch.</em> This qoute touches dearly in my heart: </p>
