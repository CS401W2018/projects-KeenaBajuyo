    <p>Welcome to my profile page. I was born and raised in the beautiful islands of the Philippines. My favorite movie series would have to be the <em>Marvel Cinematic Universe</em>, which includes the famous <strong>Avengers</strong> movies. I love all the heroes in the movies; they all have unique abilities, personalities, and stories that resonate with me, which is why I can relate to them. However, if I were to choose my favorite heroes, they would be: </p>

    <h3><mark>Top 5 favorite heroes:</mark></h3>
    
    <ol type ="A">
        <li>Wanda Maximoff - Scarlet Witch</li>
        <li> Tony Stark - Iron Man</li>
        <li>Stephen Vincent Strange - Doctor Strange</li>
        <li> Carol Danvers - Captain Marvel</li>
        <li>Steve Rogers - Captain America</li>
    </ol>

   <p>In fact, during my senior year in high school, our graduation photo had two themes: one formal attire and the other a person who inspires you or what you want to become. Although heroes are fictional characters, I still chose to portray my favorite hero because she inspires me to be brave despite the uncertainties, and that is Wanda Maximoff, <em>also known as</em> <strong>The Scarlet Witch.</strong> My favorite quote, which she said in one of the Avengers movies where she decides to accept and face her fears, touches my heart dearly:
        <blockquote>"I can't control their fear, only my own." &hearts; </blockquote>
    <h2> - Wanda Maximoff - The Scarlet Witch</h2>
