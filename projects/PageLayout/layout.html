            <p>It is an adaptation of a Wattpad book entitled "<em>Ang Mutya Ng Section E</em>," a Filipino romantic-comedy sequel. It is about a girl named Jasper Jean Mariano, most commonly known as <strong>Jay Jay</strong>. Transferring to a new school and trying to stay out of trouble, she was then assigned to a section where there are 16 troubled boys. Since she was a troubled girl, she was moved there to be surrounded by people who also made mistakes. She is related to one of her section's greatest nemeses, <strong>Aries</strong>, who is Jay Jay's cousin. She was then used by the class president, <strong>Kiefer Watson</strong>, to get back at Aries, trying to play with her feelings by making her fall in love with him and then breaking her heart to trigger Aries.</p>
            <p>Jay Jay, though being a troubled girl, is also someone who manages to take care of the people she loves. This is why most of the guys in the section started appreciating her, protecting her, and falling in love with her. Because of her quirkiness, she helped make changes to the people she loves. This then created a great conflict, making her question which side she should be on: her section or her family? I guess we'll figure it out at the end of the series.</p>
            <p>The first series was released in January 2025. It is still ongoing and is expected to end its last episode in April 2025, with a total of 16 episodes.</p>
