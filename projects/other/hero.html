Born in  I admire his playstyle, skills and most especially his clutch moments that have been very crucial in helping his team. A little bit of his background he started playing basketball since at age 9 and started playing professionally at age 18.</p>

        <h2> Charity & Foundation </h2>
        <p> He was not able to earn a degree, but despite this he used his platform and earnings to help the people in need. over $100 million to education and charity. He is known for his philanthropic efforts, which include the LeBron James Family Foundation and the I PROMISE program. Which is one of the reason why I admire him the most. He often gets criticized whenever he has bad plays, but I don't really mind seeing him loose because to me he is a great person that inspires me to be hardworking, generous and humble. </p>
