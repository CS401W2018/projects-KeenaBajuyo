        <h3>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS. </h3>
        <p> <strong>Inline CSS </strong> is directly written in the style attribute that is present within an HTML tag. </p>
        <p> <strong>Embedded CSS </strong> goes inside the <strong>style tag</strong> and within the head of the HTML document. </p>
        <p><strong>External CSS</strong> is written separately in a <strong>.css</strong> file, which is linked to the HTML document.</p>
        <h3>Explain why you should only use external CSS. </h3>
        <p>By using <strong>external CSS</strong>, it will help my HTML files become cleaner and more organized. It also makes it easier to update styles across multiple pages and improves loading times by allowing browsers to cache the CSS file.</p>
        <h3>What is a selector used for? </h3>
        <p>A <strong>selector</strong> targets specific HTML elements to apply styles to them.</p>
