        <h2>What is normal flow in HTML?</h2>
        <p>A normal flow signifies elements that is displayed so that they become visible in the code, with block elements piled up vertically and inline elements flowing horizontally. </p>
        <h2>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h2>
        <p>Float lets an element be positioned either left or right of its container, with other content circling around it. Clearing it ensures that subsequent elements start below the floated element, stopping them from wrapping around it.</p>
        <h2>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h2>
        <p><strong>Absolute</strong> positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (or the initial containing block if none exists), removing it from the normal flow.</p>
        <p><strong>Fixed</strong> positions an element relative to the viewport, meaning it will <strong>STAY</strong> in the same place even when the page is scrolled.</p>
        <p><strong>Relative</strong> positions an element relative to its normal position, without removing it from the normal flow.</p>
        <h2>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h2>
        <p>To produce navigation buttons that is mobile-friendly it needs to be responsive, touch-friendly, simple, and visually appealing with clear labels and appropriate spacing.</p>
        <h2>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h2>
        <p>Go to Canvas, find the date or topic for the project, then press lecture notes on that designated topic. As you press that, various tutorial videos that were discussed in class will help and guide you.</p>
