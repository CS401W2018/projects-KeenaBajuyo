            <h2>Questions:</h2>
            <h3>What should you focus on during class and after class?</h3>
            <p>During class, we should focus on what Brother Slade is teaching. At the same time, be hands-on with what he is doing. That way, after class, since you already have a starting point, you can experiment on how to improve and make it your own version.</p>
            <h3>What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</h3>
            <p><strong>CSS Grid</strong> is two-dimensional, meaning it can handle both columns and rows. It's like authoritarian parents who dictate exactly where each element should go and what size it should be.</p>
            <p><strong>CSS Flex</strong>, on the other hand, is one-dimensional, meaning it only handles either columns or rows at a time. It's like permissive parents who tell elements where to go but allow them to be flexible in terms of size.</p>
