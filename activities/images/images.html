        <h3><span class="questions">When should you use a background image, and when should you use the IMG tag?</span></h3>
        <p><span class="answers">Background images are mainly used for beautifying purposes, such as putting a background image on a website. On the other hand, the IMG tag is utilized for content images, such as images that are connected to the content of a website.</span></p>
    <ul class="mylist">
        <li>Repeating - These are background images that repeat both horizontally and vertically to fill the entire background of an element.</li>
        <li>Non-repeating - An image which will not repeat appearing as a background of an element, but rather only once.</li>
        <li>UL images - These are images used in marking unordered list items; most of the time set through CSS to replace default unordered list bullet points.</li>
