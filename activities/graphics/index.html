        <h4><span class="questions">What kind of photos are good to encode using GIF?</span></h4>
        <p><span class="answers">GIFs are great for simple images like cartoons and animations because they handle limited colors well.</span></p>

        <h4><span class="questions">How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</span></h4>
        <p><span class="answers">On a Mac, you can resize photos by opening them with Preview and selecting 'Adjust Size' from the Tools tab. On Windows, you can use Paint or the Photos app to resize photos. </span></p>
        <h4><span class="questions">Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS? </span></h4>
