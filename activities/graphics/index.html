        <h4><span class="questions">How do you resize your photo to the size it should be displayed?</span></h4>
        <p><span class="answers">If you are using Mac, open the photo in Preview and go to Tools 'Adjust Size', while if you are in Windows, you may use either Paint or the Photos app.</span></p>
        <h4><span class="questions">Why should you resize photos using photo editing software instead of resizing it using CSS? </span></h4>
        <p><span class="answers">If you are resizing photos with editing software it would maintain the image quality. If you do it in CSS, resizing a photo would make the quality of the photo blurry or pixelated.</span></p>
