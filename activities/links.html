    <h2> Engangement Questions</h2>
        <h3>Link to an outside website with an absolute link.</h3>

        <h3>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. </h3>
        <p> An <strong>absolute link</strong> contains the full URL. It is typically used to direct the user to a different webpage. </p>
        <p> A <strong>relative link </strong> provides a path relative to the current page's location. It links resources from the same website, making them easier to locate. </p>
        <h3>Why would you use relative links?</h3>
        <p> It is a simpler way to direct users, provides shorter URLs, and is also very convenient for when you want to improve some spots on your website because it is more localized in terms of the file. Additionally, it builds consistency. </p>
        <h3>Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder). </h3>
        <p> <a href="structural.html"> Previous Engagement</a> </p>
        <h3>List the 3 rules with relative links.</h3>
        <p> 
            <ol>
            <li>Link using the same folder.</li>
            <li>Utilize <strong>../</strong> to move up one directory level. You can <mark>chain multiple ../ </mark> to <strong>move up</strong> multiple levels.</li>
            <li>Identify the path from the present directory to the aimed file: Specify the path from the current directory to the target file.
            </li>
        </ol> 
        </p>
        <h3>Link to your last project. </h3>
        <p><a href="other/page.html">Last project</a></p>
        <h3>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?
        </h3>
        <p>No! Links can be used and placed anywhere as long as you create a hyperlink. NAV is just a way to organize and group parts of the webpage, making it as neat as possible.  </p>
