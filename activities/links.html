    <h2> Engangement Questions</h2>
        <h3>Link to an outside website with an absolute link.</h3>
        <p>Follow me on Instagram. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/knbajuyo/">click here</a></p>
        <h3>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. </h3>
        <p> An <strong>absolute link</strong> contains the full URL. Typically use to direct user to the different webpage. </p>
        <p> A <strong>relative link </strong> provides a path relative to the current page's location. It links resources from the same website making it easier to locate. </p>
        <h3>Why would you use relative links?</h3>
        <p> It is a simplier way to direct users, provides shorter URL's, it is also very convenient for when you wanna improve some spots in your website because it is more localized in terms of the file and also it builds consistency.  </p>
        <h3>Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder). </h3>
        <p> <a href="structural.html"> Previous Engagement</a> </p>
        <h3>List the 3 rules with relative links.</h3>
        <p> 
            <ol>
            <li>Link using the same folder.</li>
            <li>Use <strong>../</strong> to move up one directory level. You can chain multiple ../ to move up multiple levels.</li>
            <li>Identify the path from the present directory to the aimed file.

            </li>
        </ol> 
        </p>
        <h3>Link to your last project. </h3>
        <p><a href="other/page.html">Last project</a></p>
        <h3>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?
        </h3>
        <p>No! links can be used and placed anywhere as long as you create a hyperlink. NAV is just a way to organize and group parts of the webpage making it as neat as possible.  </p>
